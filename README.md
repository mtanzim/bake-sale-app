## Lessons Learned

- Callbacks for setState
- What to put place in app state vs what to leave out?
  - Main question: Does the element impact UI or not?
  - [When does react re-render?](https://lucybain.com/blog/2017/react-js-when-to-rerender/)
    - > A re-render can only be triggered if a componentâ€™s state has changed. The state can change from a props change, or from a direct setState change. The component gets the updated state and React decides if it should re-render the component. Unfortunately, by default React is incredibly simplistic and basically re-renders everything all the time. Component changed? Re-render. Parent changed? Re-render. Section of props that doesn't actually impact the view changed? Re-render.

- Compoments can be remounted by changing the props on the parent (ie: `key`)
